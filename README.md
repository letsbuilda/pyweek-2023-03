# Slayer in the Shadows

Our entry to **[PyWeek 35](https://pyweek.org/35/)**.

Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the game. We wanted to add in levels, enemy sprites, and ranged weapons,
but we all got busy with life. However, we still want to show off what we had, and we will still probably work on it and
finish later.

## Installation

You may either run the game from this source or install it from PyPI. If you downloaded
this from PyWeek, it is recommended to run from source so that you install less things.

### Source

In the directory of this project, run the following:

```commandline
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m run_game
```

> Note: Replace `python` with the proper executable name. On Windows, this is usually `py` and on other systems, it's
> usually `python3`.

### PyPI

The game is also available on the Python Package Index, and can be installed with one command:

```commandline
python -m pip install slayer-in-the-shadows
python -m slayer_in_the_shadows
```

## Controls

Jump: W or Space  
Right: D  
Left: A  
Attack: Left click
