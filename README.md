# Slayer in the Shadows

Our entry to **[PyWeek 35](https://pyweek.org)**.

Note: Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the game. We wanted to add in levels, enemy sprites, and ranged weapons,
but we all got busy with life. However, we still want to show off what we had, and we will still probably work on it and
finish later.

## Installation

You can install the game from PyPI and run it with Python:

```commandline
python -m pip install slayer-in-the-shadows
python -m slayer_in_the_shadows
```

> Note: Replace `python` with the proper executable name. On Windows, this is usually `py` and on other systems, it's
> usually `python3`.

## Controls

Jump: W or Space  
Right: D  
Left: A  
Attack: Left click
